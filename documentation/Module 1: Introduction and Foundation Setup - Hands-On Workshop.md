| Migration Costs             | $X,XXX         | –                     | Data transfer, application modification            |
| Training and Certification  | $X,XXX         | –                     | Team upskilling                                    |
| Operational Changes         | $X,XXX         | $XXX                  | New tools and processes                            |
| Risk Mitigation             | $XXX           | $XXX                  | Security and compliance                            |
| Opportunity Costs           | $X,XXX         | –                     | Development delays                                 |
| **Total TCO**               | $X,XXX         | $X,XXX                | Complete picture                                   |

2. Calculate Break-Even Analysis
